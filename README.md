# Google-Play-Store Exploratory Analysis
Hi! Welcome to a deep dive into Google Play Store data. 

# About The Data
This dataset is available in kaggle for download. It was updated by a student with the username YASH16JR. It is called Google_Play_Store_Cleaned.

It originally contains 9638 rows and 14 columns. Those columns are 'app', 'category', 'rating', 'reviews', 'installs', 'type', 'price', 'content_rating', 'genres', 'current_ver', 'android_ver', 'size(kb)', 'update_month', 'update_year'.

# Why Does This Matter?
Businesses and multiple industries have gained valuable insights into their processes, research, sales tactics, and more through data. Our ability to gather this data has increased dramatically since the internet was created. Soon after, applications made their debut and changed the way the world communicated.

According to Statista, nearly 90% of Americans, or about 300 million people, use a smartphone. We live in a society where applications are a structural part of life.
There is no denying that applications are here to stay, whether for news, communication, entertainment, etc.

This dataset contains information about application features such as ratings, categories, installs, reviews, and prices. Through this information, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of the world of applications.
